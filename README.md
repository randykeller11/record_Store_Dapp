# record_Store_Dapp
<p> Solidity smart contract for a decentralized record store using ERC 720 and ERC 20 tokens. This game involves both ERC720 and ERC20 tokens to create a decentralized exchange for a new kind of crypto asset.
The erc721 token is representative of the mint condintion value of a real world vinyl recording. I am defining this variable
as the highest sale value for the record using the discogs api and web3.js. A record cannot be repeated once uploaded to the block chain which
I believe will create a strong value incentive for the ERC20 token used to barter on the exchange. Extra functionality I plan to add is a speculators 
market that will reward players with ERC20 if the ERC720 sells for the value they guessed. </p>
